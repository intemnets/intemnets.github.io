<h4><b>We are looking for passionate graduate and undergraduate students to join our lab!</b></h4>

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:gustavo.vejarano@lmu.edu) if you are interested in joining our lab. We welcome students who have a strong passion for research and discovery. We are particularly interested in self-motivated students willing to commit for multiple semesters to any of our projects.

LMU students can join our lab for research assistantships, MS thesis, graduate and undergraduate capstone projects, independent studies, and/or work study.

Prospective students need to apply and be admitted to one of the academic programs of our [department](https://cse.lmu.edu/department/electricalandcomputerengineeringdepartment/) to be considered.

Thank you very much for your interest!
